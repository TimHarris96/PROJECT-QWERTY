      Welcome to Project QWERTY, this is an app for people with aphasia.<br>
      This app has been made by Monash University students and Monash Health speech pathologists working alongside people with aphasia. It is a work in progress.
      <br><br>
      Currently this website works best on Google Chrome, we are working on making this website fully functional on other browsers<br>
      We would like to make this the best tool possible for people with aphasia. So if you notice any issues or bugs and would like to report them, please email projectqwerty2020@gmail.com.
